You can define different paths the workflow can take based on the output of an agent or the current state.

It defines a State dictionary to hold the conversation history as a list of messages, utilizing Annotated with add_messages for automatic message appending. The workflow consists of a single node, \"chatbot,\" which takes the current state, invokes an LLM with the message history to get a response, and returns the response to be added to the state. The graph is then built with the \"chatbot\" node connected from the START and leading to the END, and finally compiled into a runnable object, ready to process conversational turns."

      "\n",
      "**Key Features:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Graph Representation of Language:** LangGraph represents words and their relationships as a graph, where nodes are words and edges represent semantic connections. This allows for a visual and intuitive understanding of how words relate to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Pre-trained Embeddings:** It leverages pre-trained language embeddings (like Word2Vec, GloVe, or SentenceTransformers) to capture semantic similarities between words.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Visualization:** LangGraph provides tools for visualizing the graph, allowing you to explore word relationships, clusters, and patterns in a visually appealing way.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Analysis:** It offers various analysis tools to study the structure of the graph, such as calculating centrality measures, identifying communities, and exploring path lengths between words.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Extensibility:** LangGraph is designed to be extensible, allowing users to add their own data and analysis methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Use Cases:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Semantic Analysis:** Understanding the relationships between words and concepts in a text.\n",
      "* **Word Embeddings Exploration:** Visualizing and analyzing pre-trained word embeddings.\n",
      "* **Network Analysis:** Studying the structure of language as a network.\n",
      "* **Concept Mapping:** Creating visual maps of related concepts.\n",
      "* **Educational Purposes:** Teaching about language structure and semantics.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Getting Started:**\n",
      "\n",
      "LangGraph is open-source and available on GitHub: [https://github.com/huggingface/langgraph](https://github.com/huggingface/langgraph). The documentation provides detailed instructions on installation, usage, and examples.\n",
